# Welcome to the **Web Programming Principles** Repository!

This resource is designed for students to explore core programming principles and modern web development using JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS, DOM, AJAX, and JSON. It includes practical examples of ES6 features and essential web technologies to build dynamic web applications.

## Description

This repository contains several examples that cover JavaScript ES6 features and essential web development topics such as:

- Introduction to JavaScript syntax
- Arrow functions
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with classes
- Promises for asynchronous code
- Destructuring assignment
- JavaScript modules
- HTML fundamentals, forms, and media
- DOM manipulation
- And more!

Each example is labeled as `example<number>.html` (e.g., `example1.html` for Introduction to JavaScript), corresponding to different lessons. This structure allows you to easily follow along with the course and build a solid understanding of JavaScript and web programming concepts.

## How to Use

To run and open the examples, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mouraleonardo/webprogrammingprinciples.git

2. Navigate to the repository folder:

    ```bash
    cd webprogrammingprinciples

3. **Open an example file in your browser:**

Each example is located in a separate HTML file. Simply double-click the `example<number>.html` file you want to run, or open it directly through your browser.

**Example**: To view the example for lesson 1, open the file `example1.html`.

4. **Run JavaScript code in the browser console:**

You can open your browser's developer tools (press `F12` or `Ctrl+Shift+I` in most browsers) to view the console and check the JavaScript output of each example.

## Prerequisites:

To make the most of these examples, you will need:

- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, or Edge) to run the HTML/JavaScript files.

- Basic knowledge of JavaScript and web development (HTML, CSS).


# Local Server Setup Guide

## Initialize npm in the repository:

```bash
npm init -y
```

## Install the http-server package:

```bash
npm install http-server
```

## Run the server:

```bash
npx http-server
```

By default, this will start the server on port 8080. You can access the examples in your web browser at http://localhost:8080.

## Accessing Example Files

Once the server is running, you can navigate to any example file in your browser. For instance, to view the example for lesson 1, go to:

```
http://localhost:8080/example1.html
```

This setup allows you to explore the examples while simulating a web server environment, making it easier to test AJAX functionality and more complex web applications.
